# Overview
### This Python code trains a MobileNetV2 model to classify plant diseases from images. The model is trained on a dataset of images of healthy and diseased plants, and can be used to identify and diagnose plant diseases in the field.

# Code structure
### The code is structured into the following sections:

1. Imports: This section imports the necessary libraries, including TensorFlow, Keras, and Matplotlib.
2. Dataset preparation: This section splits the dataset into train, validation, and test sets. The train set is used to train the model, the validation set is used to evaluate the model during training, and the test set is used to evaluate the model after training.
3. Model definition: This section defines the MobileNetV2 model architecture. The model is pre-trained on ImageNet, and the top layer is removed and replaced with a global average pooling layer and a softmax layer.
4. Model compilation: This section compiles the model with the Adam optimizer and categorical crossentropy loss function.
5. Model training: This section trains the model on the train set, using the validation set to monitor the model's performance and prevent overfitting.
6. Model evaluation: This section evaluates the model on the test set to measure the model's accuracy on unseen data.
7. Model saving: This section saves the trained model to a file so that it can be used to make predictions on new data in the future.
